# This file needs to live in the tests directory (i.e. we can't use the
# pyproject.toml-style config) in order to set the pytest root to something other than
# the actual modeStep module directory. Otherwise, pytest attempts to import the
# modeStep module at the beginning of each test, which doesn't work because Live
# dependencies aren't available outside the Live runtime.
#
# Notes: the bad import started happening sometime after pytest@6. It happens during
# collector setup within `SetupState#setup` (called within `pytest_runtest_setup`),
# where apparently a `Package` collector gets created for the module
# directory. Customizing `pytest_collect_directory` doesn't help, since the import
# happens at runner time rather than at initialization/collection time.

[pytest]
# Allow output.
